## üç¶ How it Works
- This script primarily relies on the SQLIte files (`user_data.db`) an OnlyFans scraper generates containing all the metadata you might want.
- This script does **not** access/scrape/download/or otherwise pull down metadata from OnlyFans or any other service.
- That said, if you don't have metadata DB files, this script _can_ try and make a good guess as your performers and associated content based on file path

## üíª Requirements

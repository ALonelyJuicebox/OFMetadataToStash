<h1 align="center">OnlyFans Metadata to Stash Powershell Script</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="/readme_assets/oldtonew.png" ></p>

**OFMetadataToStash** is an OnlyFans metadata import tool for Stash, written in Powershell.

* Simple to use with a straightforward command line based UI!
* Script can auto-associate scenes/images with the appropriate OnlyFans performer(s) and studio, in batch!
* Built-in utility for completely scrubbing and sanitizing OnlyFans metadata databases
  


## üç¶ How it Works
- This script primarily relies on the SQLIte files (`user_data.db`) an OnlyFans scraper generates containing all the metadata you might want.
- This script does **not** access/scrape/download/or otherwise pull down metadata from OnlyFans or any other service.
- That said, if you don't have metadata DB files, this script _can_ try and make a good guess as your performers and associated content based on file path

## üíª Requirements
- Stash v0.23.1 ([Released 2023-10-14](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/releases/tag/v0.21.0))
- Any major operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux) running [Microsoft Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3)
- The [PSSQLite](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSSQLite) and [PSGraphQL](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSGraphQL/1.6.0) PowerShell modules


## üìñ How to Run

1. Ensure the latest version of [Microsoft Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3) is installed. 
5. Open a Powershell prompt in the same directory as the script and run the command `.\OFMetadataToStash.ps1` to start the short configuration wizard
